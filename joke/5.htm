<blockquote>
<p>A guy is standing on the corner of the street smoking one cigarette after another.</p>

<p>A lady walking by notices him and says “Hey, don’t you know that those things can kill you? I mean, didn’t you see the giant warning on the box?!”</p>

<p>“That’s OK” says the guy, puffing casually “I’m a computer programmer.”</p>

<p>“So? What’s that got to do with anything?”</p>

<p>“We don’t care about warnings. We only care about errors.”</p>
</blockquote>
