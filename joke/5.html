<blockquote>
<p>A guy is standing on the corner of the street smoking one cigarette after another.</p>

<p>A lady walking by notices him and says &#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t you know that those things can kill you? I mean, didn&#8217;t you see the giant warning on the box?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s OK&#8221; says the guy, puffing casually &#8220;I&#8217;m a computer programmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So? What&#8217;s that got to do with anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t care about warnings. We only care about errors.&#8221;</p>
