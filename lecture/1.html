<h2 id="computerscience">Computer Science?</h2>

<p>The response I hear quite often when I tell people I study computer science is something akin to &#8220;Oh, gosh I could <em>never</em> do that I&#8217;m so bad with computers in general&#8221;.</p>

<p>When I first started I would quite often correct them, but by now the response is so ubiquitous that I&#8217;ve more or less given up. It&#8217;s not even that they mean much offense by it &#8211; I do believe they genuinely believe this to be true. It&#8217;s just sad that there is such a misperception when it comes to what computer science really is. And it&#8217;s not their fault.</p>

<p>The term <em>computer</em> science is rather misleading: it is <em>not</em> the science of computers. Strangely enough, computer science has virtually nothing intrinsically tied with computer as we know them to be in the modern era.</p>

<p>Let me put this way: Saying you cannot do well in computer science because you do not know how to set up your TV is like saying you couldn&#8217;t be a doctor because you can&#8217;t get this one EKG machine to work all the time. The CS degree is not about figuring out how to fix your grandmother&#8217;s computer. It&#8217;s not about knowing the solution to why your Microsoft Word crashes all the time. Not even close.</p>

<p>At its heart, computer science is about how to solve problems. Developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>, or procedures, to tackle various problems. What kinds of problems, you might ask. No, not like how to install the latest game on your computer. That&#8217;s tech support, but you&#8217;d be wise not to think lowly of them either.</p>

<p>The kinds of problems I&#8217;m talking about are some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a social graph (Facebook, machine learning)</li>
<li>how to make self driving cars (Google)</li>
<li>analyze millions of tweets per second to find spammers (Twitter)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This</em> is computer science.</p>

<h2 id="diversity">Diversity</h2>

<p>When most people think computer science, the word cubicle is not far behind. People assume computer scientists just sit around and code all day long. I wonder won&#8217;t why people don&#8217;t think doctors all just sit and prescribe medicines all day long? We computer scientsts have likely marketed ourselves rather poorly.</p>

<p>There is an incredible diversity within computer science. Our very own <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~prasad/">Professor Jayanti</a> is an incredible algorithms expert; he specializes in theory. He is known for proudly proclaiming that he hasn&#8217;t coded in nearly a decade!</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are the newly burgeoning fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, headed by Professors <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~devin/">Balkcom</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~lorenzo/home.html">Torressani</a>.</p>

<p>Our very own Professor <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~farid/">Farid</a> is something of a genius when it comes to image analysis (check out his photo forensics course &#8211; it&#8217;s a whole course on how to tell whether an image is photoshopped or not!).</p>

<p>And many other fields like security (Professor <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/">Smith</a>,) compilers (Professor <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/">Cormen</a>,) smartphones and networks (Professor <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/">Campbell</a>), and so many others that even I don&#8217;t know!</p>

<p>The point is that if you think all computer science offers you is a desk job where you sit and code in front of a computer all day, you&#8217;re sorely mistaken.</p>

<h2 id="intimidation">Intimidation</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the field of computer science is not without its own <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/01/programmer_privilege_as_an_asian_male_computer_science_major_everyone_gave.html">exclusivity</a>. It, like all other fields, has its own problems. But a major issue that many people feel is that unlike the stereotypical Asian male who&#8217;s been programming since he was eight years old, they don&#8217;t know about computers, so they can&#8217;t cut it.</p>

<p>Let me tell you: yes, you can.</p>

<p>When I first came here I was hell-bent on never taking a CS course. Why? Both my parents are computer scientists. I didn&#8217;t know a darn thing about computers growing up, but I knew one thing &#8211; I sure as heck didn&#8217;t want to be like my parents.</p>

<p>All my friends played video games and would talk about their RAMs and GPUs and how cool their new hard drives were, and I would sit and twiddle my thumbs thinking &#8220;What the heck is going on?&#8221; I decided early on that I wasn&#8217;t good at computers, and coming to Dartmouth was no different.</p>

<p>The first time I programmed was freshman spring, taking CS5 (the old version of CS1). There were kids who had been programming for <em>literally</em> a decade longer than I had. But those kids aren&#8217;t going to be taking CS1; and even if they are, this class is not on a curve. Their success is not going to make you a failure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;ll be easy. I&#8217;m not saying that you can put in three hours of work a week and get an A. But the excuse that you haven&#8217;t been programming while others have been is irrelavent: this is designed to be an introductory course that assumes <em>no</em> knowledge of programming. None.</p>

<p>Professor Cormen has famously said this multiple times, and it&#8217;s quite true:</p>

<p>Can you read? Can you use computers well enough to send an email? If so, you&#8217;ve met the pre-requisites for this class.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Welcome to CS1! <code>:)</code></p>
