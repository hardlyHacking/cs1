<p>For your first lab, you&#8217;ll be making the old arcade pong game. Most of the actual assignment details and pseudocode are described well and in detail on the lab page, so I won&#8217;t be repeating that information here. Instead, we&#8217;ll be going over information you&#8217;ll need about the lab.</p>

<h2 id="functionbreakdown">Function Breakdown</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s important from a design point of view to break apart this large coding assignment into multiple smaller functions. So how do you break down a large code project into multiple functions?</p>

<ol>
<li>Think of common functions you&#8217;ll be repeating multiple times.</li>
</ol>

<p>What ideas come to mind? Remember, this is just meant to be a laundry list.</p>

<ul>
<li>Checking whether the left paddle is out of bounds</li>
<li>Checking whether the right paddle is out of bounds</li>
<li>Checking whether the ball is out of bounds</li>
<li>Retrieving input from the keyboard</li>
<li>Checking whether a ball has hit the top or bottom wall</li>
<li>Checking whether a ball has hit the left or right wall</li>
<li>Checking whether a ball has hit the left paddle</li>
<li>Checking whether a ball has hit the right paddle</li>
<li>Change the direction of the ball, depending on what it hits</li>
<li>Keep track of the score</li>
</ul>

<p>Great. That&#8217;s a good list of things we&#8217;ll have to do for this lab. So what&#8217;s the next step?</p>

<ol>
<li>Generalize your many specific functions to fewer functions.</li>
</ol>

<p>When we are looking for functions to generalize, start with functions that are very similar with just minor differences. It&#8217;s bad coding practice to have almost similar code repeated many times. A good design maximizes generality.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with these two as an example:</p>

<pre><code># Checking whether a ball has hit the left paddle
hit_left_paddle()
# Checking whether a ball has hit the left paddle
hit_right_paddle()
</code></pre>

<p>to check whether the ball hit the left paddle and the right paddle, the solution is obvious: Why don&#8217;t we combine the two so that a single function is in charge of handling whether a ball hit a paddle.</p>

<p>But how do we know <em>which</em> paddle it hit?</p>

<p>With a little thought, you can see that we can pass a parameter. How about we pass a parameter like an <code>int</code> &#8211; if it&#8217;s <code>0</code>, then we check for the left paddle, and if it&#8217;s <code>1</code> we check for the right paddle.</p>

<p>But we do even <em>need</em> to know which paddle the ball hit? Why not check both every time? Great! We&#8217;ve condensed these two functions down to just one function, <code>hit_paddle()</code>!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s keep generalizing. What about the functions to check whether a ball hits something?</p>

<p>There are two types of surfaces a ball can hit: a vertical surface and a horizontal surface. Why don&#8217;t we generalize further? Because different actions result in these cases. If the ball hits a horizontal surface, the <code>x</code> direction of the ball doesn&#8217;t change, only the <code>y</code>; if a ball hits a vertical surface, the opposite happens.</p>

<p>So we&#8217;ve effectively combined the &#8220;check vertical wall collision&#8221; and &#8220;check paddle collision&#8221; functions into one. Now we just have one function for <em>all</em> horizontal surfaces, and one function for all vertical surfaces. Great! Can we do better?</p>

<p>What about checking whether each paddle is out of bounds of the screen? Can we use function to test both paddles? Why not? If we passed a parameter to the function where <code>0</code> was the left paddle and <code>1</code> was the right paddle, or something akin to that, we could easily do that.</p>

<p>In fact, we can do even better than passing this &#8220;flag&#8221; parameter telling us which paddle we&#8217;re talking about. Since both paddles have the same width and length, and we know the paddles cannot move horizontally, the <em>only</em> thing we need to know is the <code>y</code> coordinate of the bottom left corner!</p>

<p>With this piece of information alone, we can construct this function.</p>

<p>These are the design questions you need to think about before starting coding right away. Your lab should have at <em>least</em> this level of function breakdown; feel free to go further, but these are the obvious ones that you should implement.</p>

<ol>
<li>Further generalization beyond the basic specs of the project.</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, that last one seemed a little mysterious. What does it mean?</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice the labs we give you have many extra credit options.</p>

<h2 id="globalscope">Global Scope</h2>

<p>Remember the LEGB rule? It&#8217;s the rule that doesn&#8217;t allow this to happen.</p>

<pre><code>def bummer():
    a = 5

bummer()
print a
</code></pre>

<p>Bummer! But if we breakdown the functions like the way we described above, we need a way to access those variables outside those functions. Otherwise what&#8217;s the point? So what can we do?</p>

<p>One option would be to make <em>every</em> variable that more than one function needs into a global variable declared at the very top of the file. But soon, your file will start to look like</p>

<pre><code>WINDOW_WIDTH = 300
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 300
PADDLE_WIDTH = 40
PADDLE_LENGTH = 40
BALL_RADIUS = 10
ball_x = 0
ball_y = 0
paddle_left_x = 0
paddle_left_y = 0
paddle_right_x = 0
paddle_right_y = 0
</code></pre>

<p>And many, many more. Ew. That is not only really bad style but also just painfully awful. This is really bad practice and an abuse of global variables.</p>

<p>This is why we use the keyword <code>global</code>. Checkout what it can do.</p>

<pre><code>def fun():
    global a
    a = 5

def notFun():
    global a
    a = 7

fun()
print a
notFun()
print a
</code></pre>

<p>Wow! Turns out, this not only doesn&#8217;t produce an error, but it outputs what we want:</p>

<pre><code>5
7
</code></pre>

<p>Even though <code>a</code> is in two separate functions, because we used the <code>global</code> keyword, Python knows we&#8217;re referring to the <em>same</em> <code>a</code>!</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to use this to minimize the number of variables at the top of your program.</p>
