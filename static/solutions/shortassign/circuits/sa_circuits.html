<h1>Short Assignment #9: Circuits <br />Due: Monday, May 26</h1>
<p> There will be no Python programming for this short
assignment. Answer each question below.</p>  For the questions that
ask you to draw a circuit, you may either draw them by hand or use any
standard drawing program (attached at the bottom of this page are
icons for the three gates that you will need). If you draw your
circuit by hand you should either photograph or scan your drawing for
electronic submission to your section leader.


<ol>
<li> Consider the following Boolean expression <code>(a <sup>.</sup>
b) + (a <sup>.</sup> c)</code>. Show that this is equivalent to the
following Boolean expression <code>a <sup>.</sup> (b + c)</code>. The
most straight forward way to show that these expressions are the same
is to build a truth table for each expression and show that they are
equivalent. You should create one truth table with columns for the
three inputs <code> a, b, c</code>, the
sub-expression <code>(a <sup>.</sup>  b)</code>
and <code>(a <sup>.</sup>  c)</code>, and the
expression <code>(a <sup>.</sup>  b) + (a <sup>.</sup>  c)</code>. You
should then create a second truth table with columns for the three
inputs <code> a, b, c</code>, the sub-expression <code>(b + c)</code>,
and the expression <code>a <sup>.</sup> (b + c)</code>. <br><br>

<li> Imagine that you have designed a circuit that uses <code>N</code>
expressions of the form <code>(a <sup>.</sup> b) + (a <sup>.</sup>
c)</code>. We replace these expressions with expressions of the
form <code>a <sup>.</sup> (b + c)</code>. How many fewer transistors
will we use when building this circuit? Briefly explain.  <br><br>

<li> Consider the following Boolean expression <code>(a +
b) <sup>.</sup> (a + c)</code>. Provide a simpler expression (fewer
gates) that is equivalent. Show that your expression is equivalent by
building truth tables for both expressions in the same way as in the
first question. <br><br>

<li> Imagine that you have designed a circuit that uses <code>N</code>
expressions of the form <code>(a + b) <sup>.</sup> (a + c)</code>. We
replace each of these with your solution to the previous question. How
many fewer transistors will we use when building this circuit? Briefly
explain.  <br><br>

<li> The NAND operator (Not And) has two inputs and one output. The
value of the output is 0 if an only if both inputs are 1. This, you
can see, is the Not of an And operator. Now, recall that an AND gate
and OR gate can each be constructed from two transistors while a NOT
gate can be constructed from one transistor and a resistor. A NAND
gate can be constructed from two transistors and one resistor. Draw
the configuration of two transistors and resistor that implement a
NAND gate. <br><br>

<li> Build a majority-rules circuit. This is a circuit that has three
inputs and one output. The value of its output is 1 if an only if two
or more of its inputs are 1; otherwise the output of the circuit is
0. For example, if the three inputs are 0, 1, 1, your circuit should
output a 1. If its three inputs are 0, 1, 0, it should output a
0. This circuit is frequently used in fault-tolerant computing
environments where a computer must keep working correctly no matter
what, for example as on a deep-space vehicle where making repairs is
impossible. In these conditions, we might choose to put three
computers on board and have all three do every computation; if two or
more of the systems produce the same answer, we accept it. Thus, one
of the machines could fail and the system would still work properly. <br><br>

You should provide the full truth-table, the sub-expressions, the
final Boolean expression, and draw the circuit. <br><br>

<li> A decoder is a special type of circuit termed a control circuit
that is used to route data on a computer. This circuit
has <code>N</code> inputs and <code>2<sup>N</sup></code> outputs.  The
<code>N</code> input values are interpreted as a single (unsigned)
binary number representing a value between <code>0</code> and
<code>2<sup>N-1</sup></code>.  The decoder's job is to determine the
value represented on its <code>N</code> input lines and then to send a
1 to one output line corresponding to this value. For example a 2-4
decoder circuit has 2 input lines and 4 output lines. If the input
values are 00, then the first output line will have a value of 1, and
the other output lines will have a value of 0. If the input values are
01, then the second output line will have a value of 1, and the other
output lines will have a value of 0, etc. <br><br>

Build a 3-8 decoder that has 3 input lines and 8 output lines. You
should provide the full truth-table, the sub-expressions, the final
Boolean expression, and draw the circuit.
