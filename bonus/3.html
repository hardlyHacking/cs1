<h1 id="listcomprehension">List Comprehension</h1>

<p>As it turns out, for loops in Python are quite slow. When you&#8217;re going through a list, there is a faster, more preferred way called <strong>list comprehension</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s learn by example.</p>

<h2 id="filter">Filter</h2>

<p>Imagine you want to filter out elements in a list. Let&#8217;s start with the old for-loop method.</p>

<pre><code>original = [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

new_list = []

for item in original:
    if item &gt; 0:
        new_list.append(item)
</code></pre>

<p>Wow, that was long. In Python, there&#8217;s almost always a really short way of doing things. Enter list comprehension.</p>

<pre><code>new_list = [item for item in original if item &gt; 0]
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it! <em>One</em> line of code! Woah. Let&#8217;s break it down.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First, every list comprehension begins with a <code>[</code> and ends with a <code>]</code>. Okay, so what&#8217;s inside?</p></li>
<li><p>The first thing inside is an expression. Here, the expression is <code>item</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, we need to know where the expression is coming from. Usually, it&#8217;s from a list somewhere. In this case, it&#8217;s originating from the list <code>original</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides that, you can add if statements to modify the values as you wish. But that&#8217;s it!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One important point to remember is that list comprehensions <em>always create new</em> lists.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take another example.</p>

<h2 id="modification">Modification</h2>

<p>Here, we want to go through a list and modify all the elements.</p>

<pre><code>original = [-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</code></pre>

<p>Again, let&#8217;s start with the for loop.</p>

<pre><code>new_list = []
for item in original:
    if item % 2 == 0:
        new_list.append(item * item)
    else:
        new_list.append(0)
</code></pre>

<p>So what are we doing? If the number is even, we are squaring it. If it&#8217;s odd, we set it to be <code>0</code>. How can we do this with list comprehension?</p>

<pre><code>new_list = [x**2 if x % 2 == 0 else 0 for x in original]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the slightly different syntax. Here, the <code>if-else</code> statement actually comes before the <code>original</code>. Why is this?</p>

<p>As it turns out, the <code>if</code> statement in Python has two purposes. One is the regular if statement that we all know and love; in this case, it goes <em>after</em> the <code>original</code>. Notably, if it goes <em>after</em> <code>original</code>, it <em>cannot</em> take an <code>else</code> clause.</p>

<p>The other purpose, however, is to serve as a substitute for the <strong>ternary operator</strong>. The ternary operator works like this:</p>

<pre><code>a = 5 if 4 &gt; 3 else 0
</code></pre>

<p>We can conditionally assign <code>a</code> a value depending on the <code>if</code> clause. In many languages, not Python though, the ternary operator has a different syntax. For example, in C and Java, it looks like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>a = 4 &gt; 3 ? 5 : 0
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, they decided <em>not</em> to use this syntax and instead just use the same old if-statement. Notably, the ternary operator <em>must</em> have an else clause in Python. And in this case, it goes _before the <code>ordinary</code>.</p>

<h2 id="printing">Printing</h2>

<p>Printing is a rather special case. In Python 2, the version that we are using, <code>print</code> is <em>not</em> a function! Isn&#8217;t that weird? It&#8217;s a kind of strange statement. In future versions of Python, this has been fixed, and it is indeed a function once more.</p>

<p>Because it&#8217;s not a function, we cannot use <code>print</code> within list comprehension. The following will <em>not</em> work:</p>

<pre><code>a = [1, 2, 3]
[print x for x in a]
</code></pre>

<p>Nope! It will throw a <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>

<p>So how can we get around this? There are two ways.</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
a = [1, 2, 3]
[print(x) for x in a]
</code></pre>

<p>Two things have happened here. First, the import statement. This import statement makes <code>print</code> into a function!</p>

<p>Second, now that print is a <em>function</em>, we have to use function syntax.</p>

<pre><code># Before
print x

# After
print(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Note the differences.</p>

<p>The other way to get around this is simply to write your own function.</p>

<pre><code>def my_print(stuff):
    print stuff

a = [1, 2, 3]
[my_print(x) for x in a]
</code></pre>

<p>And that, too, works.</p>

<h2 id="nestedloops">Nested Loops</h2>

<p>As it turns out, any set of nested loops that are iterating over lists can <em>also</em> be done with list comprehension!</p>

<pre><code>x = '12345'
y = 'abc'

for num in x:
    for letter in y:
        print x+y
</code></pre>

<p>What does this print?</p>

<pre><code>1a
1b
1c
2a
2b
2c
3a
3b
3c
4a
4b
4c
5a
5b
5c
</code></pre>

<p>Okay. How can we replicate this?</p>

<pre><code>[print(x+y) for x in '12345' for y in 'abc']
</code></pre>

<p>Woah! Our list comprehensions can actually use <em>multiple</em> lists!</p>

<p>What about two dimensional lists?</p>

<pre><code>original = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
for x in original:
    for y in x:
        print y
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this is simply</p>

<pre><code>0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</code></pre>

<p>The list comprehension version?</p>

<pre><code>[print(y) for x in original for y in x]
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty nifty!</p>
