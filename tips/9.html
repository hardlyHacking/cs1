<p>Using the types of logic gates we discussed, we can start building simple circuits and mimic what actual computers do.</p>

<p>First, though, we need to know how to represent these gates.</p>

<p>Here are all of the gates we discussed. Notice that exclusive or is labeled EOR instead of XOR, and XNOR is labeled ENOR instead; either way is fine &#8211; the critical portion is the way the gate is drawn.</p>

<p>Couple guidelines when drawing gates:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is important for the and gate&#8217;s back to be a straight line, and the or gate have a curve at the back.</p></li>
<li><p>To invert (or &#8220;not&#8221;) a gate, you simply add a small circle in the front. Hence, the difference between the and and nand gates is just a small circle. Same with or and nor, and xor and xnor.</p></li>
<li><p>The lines behind xor and xnor gates should also be curved.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When drawing gates on an exam, we will absolutely be docking points if your gates aren&#8217;t looking as they should be. Penmanship is important in this case!</p>

<p>In this class, these gates are all one-bit inputs; that is, each A and B you see in the diagram above is just a single bit. (8 bits = 1 byte.)</p>

<h2 id="exampleproblem:comparecharacters">Example Problem: Compare Characters</h2>

<p>A character is usually 1 byte (8 bits). Design a circuit that will determine if two characters are the same.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll have to have 8 gates because all of our gates only take 1 bit per input, and they are all 2-input gates. The first step is figuring out which gates produce true when both inputs are the same.</p>

<p>The gate that does this best is xnor. When both inputs are false, xnor produces true; when both inputs are false, xnor produces true. In every other case xnor produces false, which is exactly what we&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s just a matter of linking up the gates together. For the two characters to be the same, the output of <em>every</em> xnor gate must be true. That sounds an awful lot like an and gate.</p>
