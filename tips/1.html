<h1 id="codingvswriting">Coding vs Writing</h1>

<p>The problem most first-time programmers struggle with is that they treat coding like it&#8217;s writing. When you write an essay, you brainstorm, you develop an outline, and you write a first draft. Then you keep editing it and revising it until you&#8217;re happy. This is because you&#8217;re something of experts of the English language.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you&#8217;re novices when it comes to Python &#8211; and that&#8217;s not a bad thing! But it <em>does</em> mean we have to change our approach to coding.</p>

<p>So when you&#8217;re faced with a daunting lab assignment (as you surely will be later on in this term,) the <em>worst</em> thing you can do is sit down, brainstorm for a bit, and write all of the code at once, thinking to yourself &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll just debug it all at once just like editing a paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is going to be miserable, and it will actually end up taking longer than the approach I&#8217;m about to suggest.</p>

<p>Write a single function. Nine times out of ten, even that single function already has a bug in it! Fix that bug <em>now</em> before trying to move on or write more functions. You should test and make sure your code works as soon as you write it. It&#8217;s more like writing one sentence and immediately making sure that it has no grammatical errors instead of writing the whole paper and proof-reading it all at once.</p>

<p>Why is this? When you&#8217;re writing a paper, even if one sentence has a typo or some small grammatical mishap, the general point still comes across. Think of readers as incredibly intelligent computers that can process what&#8217;s happening even though there are language errors.</p>

<p>Computers, however, are extremely stupid. They can <em>only</em> do what you tell them to, and if you have a tiny error in one of your functions, your entire program doesn&#8217;t work. Even worse, the functions that <em>call</em> the broken function don&#8217;t work, so you have no idea where to start looking for the error!</p>

<p>This is why it&#8217;s absolutely critical to write small amounts of code at a time and debug them immediately rather than later.</p>
