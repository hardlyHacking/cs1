<h1 id="recursion">Recursion</h1>

<p>What is recursion? Typically, this is where we break out the references to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Inception</a>.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s go deeper.</p>

<h2 id="whyrecursion">Why Recursion?</h2>

<p>What is recursion? Recursion is when a function can call itself. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>def donald_trump():
    print &quot;Donald Trump!&quot;
    print &quot;Who's the most handsome, awesome person in the world?&quot;
    print &quot;Hmm, not sure. I know! I'll ask the incredibly knowledgeable&quot;
    donald_trump()
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the incredibly annoying <code>donald_trump</code> function is recrusive because it calls itself.</p>

<p>The opposite of the recursive approach is iteration, whic is what you have been programming in so far. Iteration is doing a series of steps, one at a time, in a linear fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Can <em>every</em> problem that is solved iteratively be solved recursively? Can <em>every</em> problem that is solved recursively be solved iteratively?</strong></p>

<p>Yes! Iterative and recursive approaches to a problem are <em>completely</em> interchangeable. So why bother using recursion?</p>

<p>Recursion is an extremely powerful tool because it allows the programmer to break down problems into smaller instances of itself. So it&#8217;s simply a matter of convenience to the programmer. Some problems are much easier to solve recursively, and thinking about it like that allows for easy solutions.</p>

<h2 id="howtorecurse">How to Recurse</h2>

<p>Every recursive function needs two critical things:</p>

<ul>
<li>A base case</li>
<li>A way to break up the problem into a smaller problem of the same kind</li>
</ul>

<p>What&#8217;s a base case? Let&#8217;s take a look at the <code>donald_trump</code> function again. What happens when we call it?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; donald_trump()
'Donald Trump!'
'Who's the most handsom, awesome person in the world?'
'Hmm, not sure. I know! I'll ask the incredibly knowledgeable'
'Donald Trump!'
'Who's the most handsom, awesome person in the world?'
'Hmm, not sure. I know! I'll ask the incredibly knowledgeable'
'Donald Trump!'
'Who's the most handsom, awesome person in the world?'
'Hmm, not sure. I know! I'll ask the incredibly knowledgeable'
'Donald Trump!'
'Who's the most handsom, awesome person in the world?'
'Hmm, not sure. I know! I'll ask the incredibly knowledgeable'
...
</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh&#8230; You see the problem. It never stops! This is recursion&#8217;s version of the infinite loop: <strong>infinite recursion</strong>. It never stops recursing! In fact, when you run this, you&#8217;ll get a <code>RuntimeError</code>.</p>

<pre><code>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
</code></pre>

<p>What&#8217;s a run time error? A runtime error is Python&#8217;s way of saying when I looked over your code, I couldn&#8217;t find any errors (no type errors, no syntax errors, etc). But when I actually <em>run</em> your code, a mysterious error pops up! This is the standard error Python will give you when you have a case of infinite recursion, so become familiar with it!</p>

<p>A base case is when it finally <em>stops</em> recursing. Let&#8217;s put a base in <code>donald_trump</code> so he finally stops talking.</p>

<pre><code>def donald_trump(num):
    if num &lt;= 0:
        print &quot;Okay, I'll stop talking now.&quot;
        return
    print &quot;Donald Trump!&quot;
    print &quot;Who's the most handsome, awesome person in the world?&quot;
    print &quot;Hmm, not sure. I know! I'll ask the incredibly knowledgeable&quot;
    donald_trump(num - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Great! Now, <em>eventually</em>, it will stop. In this case, the smaller problem is literally the exact <em>same</em> problem, just with <code>num</code> decremented by one.</p>

<h2 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h2>

<p>There are usually several common pitfalls when students first start using recursion. Let&#8217;s go over them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Infinite recursion</li>
</ol>

<p>We saw this above with the absurd <code>donald_trump</code> example. If you don&#8217;t have a base case, you&#8217;ll end up in a bad mess.</p>

<p>A problem can have multiple base cases, though. You should carefully examine what the base and recursive cases will be before you start coding to ensure you reach all of them.</p>

<p><strong>1. Return propogation</strong></p>

<p>Often times, our function needs to return something. For some reason, when recursion is introduced, students trip up over the return statement. Let&#8217;s go over a basic example.</p>

<p>Imagine that you didn&#8217;t have the <code>len</code> operator. How could you calculate the length of a list? We could do this recursively!</p>

<pre><code>def my_len(some_list, some_number):
    if some_list == []:
        return some_number
    else:
        my_len(some_list[1:], some_number + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Will this work? No, it certainly won&#8217;t. But why not?</p>

<p>What does the base case do? It checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns the number that we passed to it. Seems fair enough. Let&#8217;s test if the base case works.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; length = my_len([], 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print length
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; length = my_len([], 6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print length
6
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough, the base case prints whatever the number we passed to it was. Great. What about the recursive case?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; length = my_len([1], 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print length
None
</code></pre>

<p>Erm&#8230; What? We know from the types lecture that <code>None</code> is returned by default if the function does not return anything. That doesn&#8217;t make sense though &#8211; we are calling another function.</p>

<p>Some of you who are observant will note that <em>calling</em> a function is not the same as <em>returning</em> the value of a called function. And indeed this is the case. We are not <em>returning</em> anything in the recursive case. Having the base case alone return something is not sufficient!</p>

<p>So how do we fix this?</p>

<pre><code>def my_len(some_list, some_number):
    if some_list == []:
        return some_number
    else:
        return my_len(some_list[1:], some_number + 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Sure enough, now that we&#8217;re returning the result of the recursive case, this works as expected.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print my_len([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 0)
7
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. Improper subproblem</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes, the second part of recursion where you break up the problem into smaller instances of the <em>same</em> problem can get tricky. Naturally, this depends on the problem at hand. Make sure you&#8217;re making the problem smaller (so it actually approaches <em>a</em> base case,) and that it is indeed the same problem.</p>

<p><strong>3. Mutual recursion</strong></p>

<p>Mutual recursion is a special case of recursion when different functions call on each other repetitively, rather than the same function.</p>

<pre><code>def even_stuff(number):
    if number == 0:
        return
    print &quot;So much stuff I'm doing! Super important stuff.&quot;
    odd_stuff(number - 1)

def odd_stuff(number):
    print &quot;Secret stuff. Can't know. #PRISM&quot;
    even_stuff(number - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we have a pair of functions, <code>odd_stuff</code> and <code>even_stuff</code>, recursing on each other. Can you guess the output of <code>odd_stuff(11)</code>?</p>

<p>Notice that <code>odd_stuff</code> doesn&#8217;t have a base case here, because it depends on <code>even_stuff</code>&#8217;s base case. To be <em>really</em> safe, we could write <code>odd_stuff</code> in this way instead:</p>

<pre><code>def odd_stuff(number):
    if odd_stuff &lt; 0:
        return
    print &quot;Secret stuff. Can't know. #PRISM&quot;
    even_stuff(number - 1)
</code></pre>

<p>This way we are guaranteed to reach <code>even_stuff</code>&#8217;s base case on all valid inputs, while ignoring invalid inputs.</p>
