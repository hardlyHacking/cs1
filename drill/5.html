<h2 id="example:studentclass">Example: Student Class</h2>

<p>What is a <code>class</code>? No, not CS1. In Python, <code>class</code> is a reserved word.</p>

<p>A class is <strong>a collection of methods</strong>. That&#8217;s it! Let&#8217;s give an example.</p>

<pre><code>class Student:

    def __init__(self, name, id):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a sample class. The only method that is defined is <code>__init__</code>. This method is special because it defines how to create objects!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s an object? An object is any data belonging to a class. <strong>Everything in Python is an object.</strong> All data belongs to <em>some</em> class. The class <code>Student</code> can create <code>Student</code> objects, and every <code>Student</code> object has two attributes: a <code>name</code> and an <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>How do I know that? I look at the <code>__init__</code> method which defines how to create objects. (Note that not every class has an <code>__init__</code> method. If it does not, you cannot create objects from that class.)</p>

<p><em>Every</em> instance of the class <code>Student</code> (another word for objects) has those two attributes, per the <code>__init__</code> method. Pretty handy.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s create a student object and fill it with attributes.</p>

<pre><code>chander = Student('Chander', '..Nice try. #topSecret')
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Notice to create a new object we used the <em>class</em> name, and not the <code>__init__</code> method; using the class name automatically calls the <code>__init__</code> method, and this way is preferred because Python does some other operations behind the scenes that we won&#8217;t discuss here.</p>

<p>How do I access the properties of <code>chander</code>?</p>

<pre><code>print chander.name
print chander.id
</code></pre>

<p>Cool! It prints out the values we gave it. The <code>.</code> operator is used to do this. But what happens when we do an attribute we never gave?</p>

<pre><code>print chander.height
</code></pre>

<p>Python spits out the following error:</p>

<pre><code>AttributeError: Student instance has no attribute 'height'
</code></pre>

<p>An <code>AttributeError</code>! In this class we will refer to these as <strong>instance variables</strong>. They are the variables defined by the <code>__init__</code> method &#8211; the variables that <em>every</em> object of the <code>Student</code> class is guaranteed to have. They are also called <strong>attributes</strong>. Here, Python is saying that this particular Student object has no such attribute called &#8220;height&#8221;, and of course it is correct.</p>

<p>But how is a class a collection of methods then? Well, let&#8217;s add some more methods and find out. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to know what their major is? No. No one cares. Let&#8217;s find out their most embarassing secret instead.</p>

<pre><code>def get_secret(self):
    return self.secret
</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh. But aren&#8217;t we going to run into the same <code>AttributeError</code> as before? Yes. So I guess we&#8217;ll have to change our <code>__init__</code> method accordingly. Here it is.</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, name, id, secret=None):
    if secret is None:
        self.secret = &quot;Nunya. Nunya beezwax.&quot;
    else:
        self.secret = None
    self.name = name
    self.id = id
</code></pre>

<p>Okay. What else? How about their hobbies.</p>

<pre><code>def get_hobby(self):
    if self.hobby == []:
        return &quot;I am a CS major. I have no hobbies.&quot;
    return self.hobby
</code></pre>

<p>Darn. That <code>__init__</code> method again. Let&#8217;s make the changes.</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, name, id, secret=None, hobby=None):
    self.secret = &quot;Nunya. Nunya beezwax&quot; if secret is None else secret
    self.name = name
    self.id = id
    self.hobby = [] if hobby is None else hobby
</code></pre>

<p>That last statement is Python&#8217;s version of the <code>ternary operator</code>. It&#8217;s a neat little trick that makes the two-line if-statement we did for <code>self.secret</code> into a nice little one-liner. For brevity, I changed the way we did <code>secret</code>, too.</p>

<p>What we mean by &#8220;a class is a collection of methods&#8221; is that every object of the <code>Student</code> class has access to <em>every</em> method defined within that class. For example, <em>every</em> new <code>Student</code> object we create can already implement the <code>get_hobby</code> and <code>get_secret</code> methods.</p>

<pre><code>chander = Student(&quot;chander&quot;, 1, &quot;I made a twelve year-old cry in Call of Duty.&quot;)
grumpyCat = Student(&quot;grumpyCat&quot;, 2, &quot;No.&quot;, &quot;No.&quot;)
doug = Student(&quot;Doug&quot;, 3, &quot;I have just met you, and I LOVE you!&quot;, &quot;SQUIRREL!&quot;)
snipe = Student(&quot;Snipe&quot;, 4, None, &quot;Chocolate.&quot;)

print snipe.get_secret()
</code></pre>

<p>Sweet. Very convenient.</p>

<h2 id="selfparameter">Self Parameter</h2>

<p>Surely you&#8217;ve noticed by now that every class <strong>method</strong> has <code>self</code> as the <em>first</em> parameter, but when you call the method, you don&#8217;t need to put in <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>This <code>self</code> refers to the object that is calling the method. In otherwords, when you do</p>

<pre><code>chander.get_hobby()
</code></pre>

<p><code>self</code> is then substituted with <code>chander</code> when that method is called. In the method headers, <code>self</code> is just a placeholder. It&#8217;s a promise to Python saying &#8220;I know this is a method, and it can&#8217;t be called by itself, but I promise that <em>some</em> object will be calling this. For now let&#8217;s just agree to call that object self.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every method that is called via an object must have a <code>self</code> parameter. Later on, we&#8217;ll look at things called class methods which aren&#8217;t called via objects. Those don&#8217;t need <code>self</code>.</p>

<h2 id="functionsvsmethods">Functions vs Methods</h2>

<p>The difference between functions and methods is often subtle but extremely important.</p>

<p>A function is independent of any class or object. You call a function like this</p>

<pre><code>function_name_example(example, parameters, go, here)
</code></pre>

<p>A method is <em>always</em> associated with some class. You call a method like this</p>

<pre><code>object_of_class.method_name(parameters, go, here)
</code></pre>

<p>What&#8217;s the minimum number of parameters for a function? Zero. A function doesn&#8217;t <em>have</em> to have any parameters.</p>

<p>What about for a method? One. Remember, <code>self</code> is always necessary for the methods we&#8217;ll be dealing with. Without a class you cannot have methods. Period. No exceptions.</p>
