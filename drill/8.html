<h1 id="datastructures">Data Structures!</h1>

<p>This part is especially important &#8211; you&#8217;re going to learn a <em>lot</em> of data structures, and it&#8217;s critical that you understand the differences between them and where / when to use them.</p>

<h2 id="0.arrayslists">0. Arrays / Lists</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m only mentioning them here for completeness. Of <em>course</em> you know what they are. One thing to mention for those of you who go onto other programming languages, is that in Python we don&#8217;t have what other languages would call traditional arrays; we have &#8220;arraylists&#8221; or &#8220;vectors&#8221;. In Python, confusingly enough, these vectors are called &#8220;lists&#8221; or &#8220;arrays&#8221;.</p>

<h2 id="1.stacks">1. Stacks</h2>

<p>You&#8217;ve already studied stacks and stack frames when it came to recursion. The key thing to remember is that stacks grow <em>downward</em> and they operate on a <strong>last in first out</strong> policy (LIFO). The <em>last</em> (most recent) thing placed on the stack is the <em>first</em> to be removed from the stack.</p>

<p>One point of terminology: putting something onto a stack is called <strong>pushing</strong> onto the stack, and removing something of a stack is called <strong>popping</strong> from the stack.</p>

<p>It takes <code>O(1)</code> to push onto a stack, and <code>O(1)</code> to pop off a stack.</p>

<h2 id="2.queues">2. Queues</h2>

<p>You are also very familiar with queues. Anytime you&#8217;ve waited in &#8220;line&#8221;, as the Americans say, you are part of a queue. Queues, unlike stacks, are <strong>first in first out</strong> (FIFO). The first person in line is the first person serviced. They are the opposite of stacks!</p>

<p>Just like a queue, it takes <code>O(1)</code> to push and pop onto/off a queue.</p>

<h2 id="3.linkedlist">3. Linked List</h2>

<p>A <em>linked</em> list is slightly different than a regular list. You <em>cannot</em> index into a linked list. A linked list is made up of nodes, which contain the data. Think of these as little cells that have some data inside of them.</p>

<p>There are two types of linked lists: singly and doubly linked.</p>

<p>In a <em>singly</em> linked list, each node has two values: the data it stores and a <code>next</code> attribute, which points to the next node in the list.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a <code>Node</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>class Node:
    
    def __init__(self, data, next=None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s all that&#8217;s inside of a node. Here is an example of creating a linked list.</p>

<pre><code>a = Node(4)
a.next = Node(6)
a.next.next = Node(8)
</code></pre>

<p>So our linked list has 3 nodes, and the order of their data is <code>4, 6, 8</code>. Notice our variable <code>a</code> only points to a single node; so we cannot index into the linked list. Instead, we have to use <code>a.next</code> if we want to get the element after <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>There are also <em>doubly</em> linked lists. Here, the nodes have both a <code>next</code> and a <code>prev</code> (previous) instance variables, so we can go backwards as well as forwards through the linked list.</p>

<pre><code>class Node:

    def __init__(self, data, next=None, prev=None):
        self.data = data
        self.prev = prev
        self.next = next
</code></pre>

<p>Adding to a linked list and removing from a linked list both take <code>O(1)</code> time. <em>Searching</em> through a linked list, however, takes <code>O(n)</code> time where <code>n</code> is the number of elements in the linked list.</p>

<h2 id="4.dictionary">4. Dictionary</h2>

<p>A dictionary is a very cool data structure that is used for finding things very quickly. In fact, in most cases (read: average / best case) it can find things you need in <code>O(1)</code>! In the worst case, however, it takes <code>O(n)</code>.</p>

<p>How does this work?</p>

<p>Dictionaries use a <strong>hash function</strong>; a good hash function maps every unique string to a unique number. <em>How</em> it does so is out of the scope of this class; suffice it to say some complex math transforms the group of characters to a unique number.</p>

<p>Think of the dictionary itself as a list of linked lists. So this number returned by the hash function could be <em>anything</em>. How do we take that number and assign it an index? Let&#8217;s use the modulus operator. If we mod the output of the hash function by the size of the dictionary, we get an index in which we can store the value!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say our hash function returned <code>1000</code> for the word <code>'bat'</code>. But the list in the dictionary is only of size <code>10</code>. So <code>1000 % 10</code> is <code>0</code>, so we assign it to the zeroeth index. But what happens if the word <code>'cat'</code> produces a hash value of <code>5000</code>? The indices are the same!</p>

<p>This is why the dictionary is a list of <em>linked</em> lists. We simply add the value to the end of the linked list. Thus, the <em>larger the dictionary, the better the outcome</em>.</p>

<p>When two unique words are assigned the same index, we call that a <strong>collision</strong>. In the worst case, the dictionary size is <code>1</code>, so it&#8217;s just a linked list. Thus, in the worst case, searching through a dictionary is the same as searching through a linked list, <code>O(n)</code>. But this rarely ever happens.</p>

<p>Adding and removing from a dictionary takes <code>O(1)</code> time because it is the same as a linked list.</p>

<h2 id="5.graph">5. Graph</h2>

<p>Graphs are data structures comprised of two things: <strong>nodes</strong> and <strong>edges</strong>. Graphs look a lot like those brainstorming diagrams we drew in elementary school where clouds had ideas, and you connected related clouds with simple lines.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Except here, isntead of brainstorming diagrams, we have neat circles and straight lines connecting them. Think of them as grown up brainstorming diagrams who have learned obedience. <code>:)</code></p>

<p>In graphs, edges can either be <strong>undirected</strong> or <strong>directed</strong>. Think of directed edges as one-way roads; you can&#8217;t travel backwards on them. Undirected edges, on the other hand, are two-way streets.</p>

<p>An example of an undirected graph.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Although theoretically the edges could also contain data, in this class, only the nodes will.</p>

<h2 id="6.tree">6. Tree</h2>

<p>Trees are a special kind of graph where you can&#8217;t find cycles. What&#8217;s a cycle? <strong>A cycle is when you can reach the same node by taking a path of unique edges and nodes.</strong>* What does that mean? Look at the image above. Imagine you start at <code>4</code>. Can you reach <code>4</code> by taking some route along the graph? Of course you can. Go to <code>5</code>, then <code>2</code>, then <code>3</code>, and voila! You&#8217;re back at <code>4</code>. That&#8217;s a cycle.</p>

<p>While a graph is a giant web-like structure, a tree looks like&#8230; well, a tree. You never see the root of a tree connecting to the leaves. Like a graph, the edges can be directional or non-directional.</p>

<p>An example of a directed tree (notice the arrows on the edges).</p>
